    <b>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b><br />
    <p>
      <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>
      <strong>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong>
      <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank"><i>Lorem Ipsum</i></a>
      has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
      unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
      specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
      into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <b>Where does it come from?</b><br />

    <p>
      <u>Contrary to popular belief, <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>is not simply random text.</u>
      <em>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
        Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
        1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
        reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
        translation by H. Rackham.</em>

    <b>Why do we use it?</b><br />

    <p>
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
      letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
      like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
      editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
      'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
      purpose (injected humour and the like).
